# COMP 765 - Intelligent Robotics

## Overview 
Robotics is the study of physical bodies that can perceive and act in the world, and for computer scientists, the focus is on the algorithms, data structures, models and math that makes a robot intelligent. Even with modern hardware, the real world can easily overwhelm a poor algorithm, so often efficient and scalable use of computation equals intelligence.

## Pre-Reqs
None formally. We aim to achieve very high-level content where a mountain of prior knowledge will help, but no one is likely to come into the course knowing everything required (including the instructor). We will acquire the skills together to search for material as we need it!

## Topic List
Please see the [lecture list](Lectures) for details and resources.
- Problems
  - Navigation
  - Manipulation
  - Learning from Data
  - Interaction with Humans
- Highlight Methods/Models
  - Bayesian Filtering
  - Optimal Control
  - Learning to Model Dynamics (aka “World Models” or “World Foundation Models”)
  - Model-based and Model-free RL for robotics problems
  - Imitation Learning including IRL
  - Active IL
  - Language-informed High-level Decision Making
  - Vision-Action-Language Models

## Assessment Plan
- Assignments (20%) a regular set of assignments, roughly one every two weeks. These will mostly be light pen-and-paper exercises for your practice.
- Lab demos (20%) we will use the dedicated robotics teaching room in TR4130
- Exams (30%) in-class midterm and final exams give you the chance to show your skills in an AI-free environment.
- Project (30%)

## Resources and Materials
We'll follow a few text books and many recent research papers that will be linked as they come up. Course notes written by the instructor will fill gaps when needed.

## Instructor: David Meger
- Primary contact method: Ed Discussion posts to discuss content, assessments, exams, etc. Mark posts as private for personalized questions. Email is the last resort.
- Email - david.meger@gmail.com (McGill email accounts are currently being “migrated” and not reliable, sorry!)
- Office: MC 112N (North Wing, walk through the 100N lobby to find my door)
- Office hours: TBD, but likely Thursdays 9-10am.

## Integrity (including AI)
McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.

This course is a gateway to the robotics research community. It is unlikely folks will opt-in just to obtain a grade via ChatGPT, collusion or similar and this will not be a major focus of our grading. For online assessments including the assignments, lab and project, it will often be the case that we ask you to use GenAI in some way, including as part of your solution method, to vibe code, or similar. We do expect reports and material written in your own voice are done by yourself, but it's OK to use tools for grammar and spelling.

## Assessment Language
In accord with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French written work that is to be graded.
